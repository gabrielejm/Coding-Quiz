# Coding-Quiz (Homework 3)

In this application, I make a 5 question coding-related quiz. When the user clicks start, a timer will begin starting at 90 seconds and a random selection of the 5 questions is chosen and shown to the user along with the 4 multiple choice answers, 1 answer choice on each button. When the user clicks an answer, they will be informed whether they were right or wrong and score will be added or deducted, and the next question and answers will appear. The timer will also be decreased by 10 seconds if the user answers incorrectly. At the end, the user will see their final score and remaining time, and will be able to add their initials to a seperate html page containing highscores.
